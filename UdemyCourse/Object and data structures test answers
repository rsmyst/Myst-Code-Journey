Answers:
Numbers -  are just numbers. It includes float values and any integer.

Strings - Anything wrapped in " or ' are strings. It could be words or even numbers.
When assigning letters or words to variables, we need to use double quotes and it becomes a string.

Lists: A set of values, either string or integer, that can be sliced and also indexed. They are of the format
list_new = ["x",4,5,1]. Their values can also be modified by calling their index value and assinging it to something else.

Tuples: Something like lists but the format is tuple = (3,4,1,"key"). They are not changeable but can be indexed.

Dictionaries: Like list but you can assign all the index values a key value to call by. So, instead of calling the
actual value stored in the dictionary, you can call the key it is assigned to.
dictionary_new = {key1:value1, key2:value2}

Equation that equals to 100.25
answer = 5**2 *4 + 2 - (3.5 / 2)
print(answer)

Find square root and square of a number.
number = 25
square = number**2
square_root = number ** 0.5
print(square, square_root)

Strings solutions:
s = 'hello'
print(s[1])
print(s[::-1])
method 1 = print(s[4])
method 2 = print(s[-1])

Lists solutions:
list_1 = [0,0,0]
list_2 =

list3 = [1,2,[3,4,'hello']]
print(list3[2][2])
list3[2][2] = "goodbye"
print(list3[2][2])
